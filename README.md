# Tête-À-Tête

## Description

A tête-à-tête, from the French "head to head," refers to a private conversation between two people.  This is an app that allows you to easily keep track of your 1:1s, including managing agendas, keeping track of to-do items, and establishing metrics over time based on employee sentiment.  Future information will be added as we get fully integrated with identity providers and scheduling tools.
